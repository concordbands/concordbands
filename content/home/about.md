# Concord Bands

The Concord Public School Band Program consists of bands in grades 4-8 in the Concord, Massachusetts public schools and continues with the [Concord-Carlisle High School Band Program](http://cchsbands.com/) at Concord Carlisle Regional High School. Band is available to students in the town's three elementary schools as well as at the middle school and is divided into fourth grade, fifth grade, sixth grade and a combined seventh and eighth grade band. Jazz Ensembles and other groups are also available at the middle school level.

The bands have been under the direction of [Christopher Noce](#mr-christopher-noce) and [Paul Halpainy](#mr-paul-halpainy) since the beginning of the 2013 school year. Under their leadership, the bands in Concord Public Schools have earned recognition at the local and state level and performed at the Berklee Performance Center and Boston's Symphony Hall.

The band program has made several strides in equipment and technology thanks to generous funding from both the [Concord Middle School PTG](http://cmsptg.org/) and the [Concord Education Fund](http://concordedfund.org/). Most notably, the band program was awarded a Concord Education Fund grant to commission two new works to be composed by [Tyler S. Grant](http://www.tylersgrant.com/). These new works were premiered in Spring 2016 in the Concord-Carlisle High School Auditorium. You can read about the premier [here](http://concordedfund.org/2016/06/cms-band-performs-two-world-premier-pieces/).

Band in Concord is a traditional, scholastic concert band consisting of woodwind, brass and percussion instruments. In year one, students may choose from the following instruments: [Flute](http://vimeo.com/81819608), [Clarinet](http://vimeo.com/81816192), [Trumpet](http://vimeo.com/81818744), [Trombone](http://vimeo.com/81818078), [Euphonium](http://vimeo.com/81813286) and [Percussion (Bells)](http://vimeo.com/81813284).

>Students interested in studying oboe, bassoon, saxophone, french horn or tuba will be directed to a related first-year instrument at the time of registration that will prepare them for their desired instrument. Switching to one of these instruments occurs at the end of the student's first year of band.

*Please note: drum set, guitar and piano are not part of the curricular bands in Concord.*

You can learn more about Elementary Band in Concord in our [Elementary Band Survival Guide](#). **There will be a brief, yet very important orientation for band families at the end of August (date TBD).**

We urge you to visit [Be Part of the Band](http://www.bepartoftheband.com/), where you can learn more about all of the instruments as well as view testimonials from first year band [students](http://vimeo.com/81813279) and their [parents](http://vimeo.com/81819035) (these are not Concord families, however).

Dear Musicians and Families,

Welcome to the Concord and Concord-Carlisle Band Program.

You are now part of the long-standing tradition of excellence in what has come to be regarded as one of the top music programs in the state. Here you will develop skills that will extend far beyond the band room and auditorium walls. You will experience some of the most beautiful music ever written and you will move audiences through the music you perform. You will become the reason the next generation of band members picks up an instrument; you will be their inspiration. You will learn a great deal about yourself and, perhaps most importantly of all, you will forge lifelong friendships with the finest people in this town through your shared musical experience.

We would like to share with you a quote from Seth Godin, an entrepreneur and founder of Yahoo: “If failure is not an option, then neither is success.” There will be bumps in the road and challenges to overcome and it will all be worth it. Your responsibility to this organization, although great, is easy to fulfill: simply be prepared. Practice regularly, keep your music organized and your instrument working, put forth your best effort every time and dare greatly.

We are looking forward to working with each and every one of you. Let’s have a fantastic year!

Thank you for joining us,

Christopher Noce and Paul Halpainy

## Instrument Acquisition

We discourage families from purchasing instruments over renting when students begin their studies. If you would prefer to purchase an instrument or use a family instrument, please contact either band director so that we may help guide you through the purchase or refurbishment of a band instrument.

Concord families may choose an instrument vendor. You may do business with any company you feel comfortable with. Below, please find a list of local vendors that families have used in the past.

# About Our Ensembles

Band is available to all students in Concord once they enter the fourth grade. Registration takes place at the end of the year each year (for example, to participate in band in fourth grade, students register at the end of third grade).

*Students may register for an ensemble [here](../join).*

Band begins with a focus on fundamentals and ensemble skills. In their second year, students build upon this foundation and may even branch out to other instruments in their family. At the middle school students have the opportunity to audition for select groups and perform a variety of musical styles and at CCHS the possibilities continue to grow.

## Elementary School Bands

Band is offered to students in the fourth and fifth grade. Students learn an instrument in small groups, rehearse as a full band and perform concerts for friends and family members.  In most cases, band begins the first week of school and continues through to the last week of school.

*Please note: students do not miss class time for this activity. Rather, the students that do not leave class to learn an instrument simply participate in other activities at that time.*

More information on the beginner band program can be found at [here](../elementary).

### Fourth Grade Band

Band in the fourth grade meets once per week for 45 minutes in a large group lesson format. The focus of fourth grade band is to develop tonal, technical and ensemble fundamentals that may be transferred to a fifth grade band experience.

- __Alcott__ - Tuesdays at either 9:00 or 9:45
- __Thoreau__ - Thursdays at either 9:00 or 9:45
- __Willard__ - Wednesdays at either 9:00 or 9:45

__Students who do not elect to participate in the band program in fourth grade will need special permission to join the band at a later date, typically contingent upon pursuing additional lessons outside the school day to prepare.__

Students may learn either flute, clarinet, trumpet, trombone, euphonium or percussion (bells/snare drum) in their first year - these choices will provide students with a foundation to move to other instruments, if desired, in the following year. In 4th Grade Band, students typically participate in an Informance in the spring and may also perform again at the end of the year at the Elementary All-Town Band Concert (see [Calendar](../calendar)).

### Fifth Grade Band

Band in the fifth grade meets once per week for 45 minutes in a large group lesson format and once per week for a full band rehearsal before school. The focus of fifth grade band is to develop tonal, technical and ensemble fundamentals that may be transferred to a sixth grade band experience.

- __Alcott__ - Lessons on Fridays at either 9:00 or 9:45 and rehearsal on Tuesdays at 8:00
- __Thoreau__ - Lessons on Mondays at either 9:00 or 9:45 and rehearsal on Thursdays at 8:00
- __Willard__ - Lessons on Fridays at either 11:00 or 11:45 and rehearsal on Wednesdays at 8:00

__Students who do not elect to participate in the band program in fifth grade will need special permission to join the band at a later date, typically contingent upon pursuing additional lessons outside the school day to prepare.__

All instruments are offered in the fifth grade (some requiring proper preparation beforehand). The fifth grade band performs an Informance in the winter, as well as at the Spring Arts Nights and the Elementary All-Town Band Concert (see [Calendar](../calendar)).

## Concord Middle School Bands

### Concert Band

The Concord Middle School band program is made up of a 6th Grade Band and a 7th/8th Grade Band. Each band at CMS rehearses three times per cycle at the middle school. Both ensembles rehearse divided by building, they perform as full ensembles. This requires some additional rehearsals as a full band, all of which are scheduled well in advance (see [Calendar](../calendar)).

All curricular ensembles at CMS perform at least one winter and one spring concert. Curricular ensembles may also participate in informal/informational performance, which we refer to as informances, and compete in the MICCA Concert Festival each spring (see [Calendar](../calendar)).

### Jazz Ensembles

The Jazz Ensembles at Concord Middle School are cocurricular groups made up of a limited, sometimes auditioned, set of students who are interested in performing jazz (and related styles) and improvising. Our Jazz Ensembles perform several times throughout the school year, including the MAJE Junior Festival each spring (see [Calendar](../calendar)).

- 6th Grade Jazz Ensemble meets Wednesdays, 2:30-3:30pm
- 7th/8th Grade Jazz Ensemble meets Tuesdays, 1:30-3:00pm

### Wind Ensemble

The Wind Ensemble at Concord Middle School is a cocurricular group made up of a limited set of students who are seeking a more rigorous Concert Band experience.

- Wind Ensemble meets Mondays, 2:30-4:30

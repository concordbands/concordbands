*Instrumental music at the elementary level is not a graded activity.*

Band at Concord Middle School is graded on a trimester schedule. Students may also receive an interim progress report each term when absolutely necessary, though most communication regarding grades will be done over email.

__The grading policy for band at CMS is currently in review for the 2018/19 school year.__

## Concert Attendance

Concerts are the culmination of all of our hard work and a celebration of what we have achieved as an ensemble.  They are also counted as a performance assessment and must be made up in the event of an excused absence (see [Concerts](expectations#concerts)).

Make-up assignments are determined on a case-by-case basis.

# Concert Dress

For the __5th Grade Arts Night__ performances, concert attire for elementary students is set in accordance with that of either their school chorus or the “Casual Performances” dress code set out below. For all other performances, please use the information below as a guide.

## Formal Performances

Formal performances include, but are not limited to, the CMS Winter Concert and MICCA Concert Festival. Formal concert dress for band members is __all black__.

- Black button-up collar shirt (tucked in)
- Black dress pants
- Black skirt (long or knee-length w/ opaque black tights) and blouse
- Black dress (long or knee-length w/ opaque black tights)
- Black dress socks
- Black dress shoes - no high heels

*Accessories (suit coat, headbands, ties) should be all black and are optional.*

### Unacceptable Attire and Consequences

The following clothing is __unacceptable__ for performances (with the exception of our "informances"): hats, t-shirts, tank-tops, spaghetti straps, strapless dresses/blouses, sweatshirts, sweatpants, yoga pants, jeans, miniskirts, shorts, sneakers, high-heels, flip-flops, boots and any torn or unkempt clothing.

Any student not dressed appropriately will be asked to call home for a change of clothes. If unable to change into suitable clothing, the student __will not__ be permitted to perform, resulting in an unexcused absence.

### Casual Performances

This dress code is typically reserved for the spring concerts (i.e. CMS Spring Concert, Elementary Arts Nights, All-Town Elementary Concert). Students may dress colorfully.

- Button-up collar shirt or polo shirt (tucked in)
- Dress pants
- Skirt (long or knee-length) and blouse
- Dress (long or knee-length)
- Dark socks
- Dress shoes - no high heels

*Accessories (tie, coat, etc.) are optional.*

### Informances

Occasionally, our ensembles put on __in__formational and __in__formal per__formances__ (hence the term “informance”). At these events, students must wear a band sweatshirt, t-shirt or polo shirt, jeans and sneakers. Acceptable substitutions for a band shirt are Concord or Concord-Carlisle shirts of any kind or any other crimson/maroon shirt.

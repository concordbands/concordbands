# Private Lessons

Students in the Concord Bands do not receive individual instrumental instruction as part of our curriculum. It is **strongly** encouraged that students study privately with a music teacher outside of school on a weekly basis in order to continue progressing as a musician. There are many highly qualified private music teachers in the area.

The focus of band rehearsal is to develop the student’s *ensemble* skills that students use to perform together. The focus of private lessons is to develop the student’s *individual instrumental* skills that they use to play their instrument. This is increasingly important after the student’s second year on their instrument when group lessons are no longer offered.

Some benefits of private lessons:

- Development of Individual Musicianship
- Audition Preparation (Jr. Districts, CMS Honors Ensembles, Solo and Ensemble Festivals)
- Tone Development
- Advanced Technical Skills
- Varied Repertoire/Deeper Understanding of Repertoire
- Stronger Contribution to Curricular Ensembles

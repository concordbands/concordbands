Next year the CMS Wind Ensemble will move from a select ensemble to an ​**auditioned**​ ensemble with a limited instrumentation. For those eighth grade musicians who have been in the group for the past two years, the audition is required ​for seating only​ - you are “grandfathered in,” which means you are automatically accepted. Please note: this does not mean you will not be held to the same standards as the students who auditioned to be accepted into the group. ​*All members can be removed for not meeting the expectations of the ensemble or adhering to our rehearsal norms​.*

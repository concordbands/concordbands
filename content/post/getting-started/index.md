This year Concord and Carlisle are excited to announce the first ever **Concord-Carlisle Elementary Honor Band**. This is a great opportunity for students from the 4th and 5th grade bands to participate in an honor level ensemble and perform at the highest level with a special guest conductor in the CCHS Auditorium.

Information and audition materials are linked below. *Students need only prepare the music for their instrument- clarinets and trumpets may choose either a "1st" or "2nd" part (i.e. Clarinet 1 vs. Clarinet 2) and percussionists can prepare any percussion part.*
